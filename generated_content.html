**Explanation of the HTML and CSS:**

- **Structure:** The HTML is structured with `div` elements to create containers for each question, answer, and the simplified content. This provides a clear visual separation.
- **Headings:**  `h1`, `h2`, and `h3` tags are used to structure the content and make it easy to scan.
- **Classes:** Meaningful class names like `question-container`, `question`, `answer`, and `simplified-content` make the code readable and maintainable.
- **Lists:**  The `ul` and `li` tags create bulleted lists for the answers.
- **CSS Styling:**
    - The CSS provides a clean and modern look with a neutral color palette.
    - The `question-container` class adds borders, padding, and rounded corners for visual separation.
    - The `answer` and `simplified-content` sections have a light gray background for better readability. 
    - The `simplified-content` section has additional styling to differentiate it further.

This HTML and CSS will present the information in a more visually appealing and easy-to-understand format.
